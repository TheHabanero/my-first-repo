      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Brian and I love video games and
    like cartoons. For years
    I have the determination to learn forever and continually
    yearn for more talents and skills. I am also usually
    organized.</p>

      <h1>My Background</h1>
    <p>During my time in high school I have gained some
    experience of using CADD, and I have graduated school with
    high honors in the end. So far, in college, I have earned a
    GPA of 4.0. Throughout my life, though, I have rarely
    touched much of programming.</p>

      <h1>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h1>
    <p>I have been thinking of wanting to program my own video
    games. Out of all the career choices I thought of starting
    with honing the skills of programming. Once I have felt
    that I can really
    program something I get excited from thinking that
    I can create a variety of programs, especially
    programming video games! I have also heard that
    programming is what was demanded by many in the
    workforce today.</p>
